### **Daily Report**

- **O (Observation):**  
  Today, I learned how to use Stream API's `filter`, `map`, and other functions, as well as common code smells like loops and long functions. I also learned refactoring techniques such as `move` to address these smells. Additionally, I explored the use of hotkeys and creating concept maps, which can help organize loose knowledge points.

- **R (Result):**  
  Overall, my learning progress was good. However, I still need to become more familiar with the "baby step" approach to coding.

- **I (Insight):**  
  Due to my previous coding habits and lack of exposure to TDD (Test-Driven Development), my steps in coding have been larger than they should be.

- **D (Development):**  
  I will focus on ensuring I follow the "baby step" approach and adopt this practice in my daily exercises and assignments to improve the way I approach coding.
